The repository is created to share content that I studied and resources I have used to learn Tensorflow.

### Disclaimer: 

I am studying this content refering to course: `TensorFlow for Deep Learning Bootcamp` by `Andrei Neagoie` and `Daniel Bourke` on Udemy: 

https://www.udemy.com/course/tensorflow-developer-certificate-machine-learning-zero-to-mastery/ 

I shall be refering the content, and add my understandings and works to this repository and not the actual course work.

The creators of the course have worked very hard in their content, and please refer their course for their original work, which is far more than what I intend to reflect upon. 


### Contents (I shall be covering):
1. Tensorflow Fundementals
2. Neural Network Regression
3. Neural Network Classification
4. Computer Vision and Convolutional Neural Network
5. Transfer Learning 1: Feature Extraction
6. Transfer Learning 2: Fine Tuning
7. Transfer Learning 3: Scaling Up
8. Time Series Fundementals
